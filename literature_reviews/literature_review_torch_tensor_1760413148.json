  "review_text": "Problem: Small, non-sequential tabular classification (torch tensor input shape (4,), 3 classes) from wearable physical-education sensors. Such problems typically have few labeled samples and low feature dimensionality—conditions under which recent tabular foundation models and strong MLP-style baselines excel. Surveys from 2024–2025 confirm that while tree ensembles remain strong in general, specialized deep tabular models and pretraining approaches increasingly dominate on small-data regimes. ([portal.fis.tum.de](https://portal.fis.tum.de/en/publications/deep-neural-networks-and-tabular-data-a-survey?utm_source=openai))\n\nMost relevant state-of-the-art: TabPFN (Prior-data Fitted Network). The 2025 Nature paper (TabPFN v2) demonstrates dominant accuracy on datasets up to 10,000 samples and 500 features, outperforming tuned SOTA baselines; notably, it achieves in 2.8 s what strong baselines require 4 h of tuning to match, yielding ~5,140× classification speedups, and scales via two-way attention for row/column invariance with memory under ~1,000 bytes per cell. It handles missing/categorical data and supports fine-tuning and uncertainty estimates. The original 2022/ICLR 2023 study showed clear gains over boosted trees and parity with complex AutoML on 18 OpenML-CC18 small numeric datasets (≤1,000 samples, ≤100 features), with up to 230× CPU and 5,700× GPU speedups. PyTorch implementations are available via the tabpfn package; v2 model cards recommend ≥16 GB RAM (GPU optional; 8 GB VRAM suffices for many tasks). These characteristics align precisely with the present 4-D, 3-class, small-sample setting. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08328-6))\n\nCompetitive deep baselines: FT-Transformer and strong MLP/ResNet-style tabular nets (rtdl) remain practical, with FT-Transformer achieving best average performance among deep models in the NeurIPS’21 study while being slower than MLP-like models. SAINT adds inter-row and column attention with SSL pretraining and reported average gains over XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost on mixed benchmarks. For very low-dimensional tabular data (like 4 features), tuned MLP/ResNet baselines can be competitive; however, recent surveys and the TabPFN results suggest foundation-model style pretraining is especially advantageous when labeled data are scarce. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11959?utm_source=openai))\n\nDomain notes (wearable activity): Much HAR literature targets sequence models on raw IMU streams; when features are aggregated to fixed-length tabular vectors (as here), tabular SOTA applies. Recent HAR surveys and datasets emphasize that strong recognition is possible from reduced sensor features, but given the small-sample focus, TabPFN’s training-free, Bayesian-approximation inference is a particularly good fit. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09678?utm_source=openai))\n\nCompute/practicalities: TabPFN v2 runs as a scikit-learn-style estimator in PyTorch; inference is fast, requires minimal tuning, provides calibrated probabilities/uncertainty, and is designed for small-to-medium tabular datasets. Recommended environment: Python ≥3.9, PyTorch ≥2.1, 16 GB RAM; GPU optional (8–16 GB VRAM recommended for larger problems).
