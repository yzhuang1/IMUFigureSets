COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW:
Problem framing: You have beat- or short-window ECG sequence data as torch_tensors shaped (1000, 2) with 5 classes, drawn from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Contemporary work typically follows the AAMI EC57 5-class mapping (N/S/V/F/Q) and emphasizes strict inter-patient evaluation to avoid leakage. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) results are achieved with 1D CNN-Transformer hybrids or lightweight Transformers; some methods convert signals to time–frequency images (e.g., wavelet scalograms) and apply vision Transformers. Data handling libraries such as torch_ecg provide ready-to-use preprocessing/dataloaders for MIT-BIH in PyTorch. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1401143/full))

Recent SOTA methods and evidence: (1) Transformer-centric models. A tiny 1D Transformer (≈6k params) reached 98.97% accuracy on 5-class MIT-BIH and demonstrated practical embedded deployment (4.28 ms, 0.09 mJ on GAP9, 8-bit inference), highlighting strong accuracy–efficiency trade-offs for short segments like 1000 samples. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10748?utm_source=openai)) (2) Image-based Swin Transformer on wavelet time–frequency maps achieved 99.34% (intra-patient) and 98.37% (inter-patient) accuracies on MIT-BIH, showing that self-attention with multiscale windows can exploit global–local dependencies; however, it requires a time–frequency transform pipeline. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1401143/full)) (3) ECGTransForm (Bi-Transformer + multi-scale 1D CNN + channel recalibration + context-aware loss) reports 99.35±0.16 accuracy and 94.26±0.28 macro-F1 on MIT-BIH, with open-source PyTorch code, making it attractive for rapid adoption and adaptation to multi-lead inputs like (1000, 2). ([github.com](https://github.com/emadeldeen24/ECGTransForm/raw/main/misc/ecgTransform_res.png)) (4) For generalization across unseen patients, adversarial learning with Patient-Invariant Beat-Score Maps improved inter-patient F1 by 14.27% (and AF class F1 by 27.70%) on MIT-BIH, underscoring the importance of patient-invariance and careful splits. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/16/7227?utm_source=openai)) (5) A 2024 SAGE study benchmarking a hierarchical deep architecture reported ≈0.993 F1 on 5-class MIT-BIH, further validating that attention-equipped, multi-stage designs are competitive at scale. ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20552076241278942?utm_source=openai))

Surveys/meta-analyses: A 2024 survey of MIT-BIH work emphasizes broad methodological trends and the utility of graph- and deep-learning approaches; it also notes the importance of standardized evaluation. These reviews, together with broader DL surveys, contextualize the shift toward attention mechanisms and lightweight deployment. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3197/12/2/21?utm_source=openai))

Computational and implementation considerations: • If you want direct 1D sequence modeling on (1000, 2), CNN–Transformer hybrids avoid image conversion overhead while capturing morphology (via CNN) and rhythm context (via attention). ECGTransForm’s released PyTorch code eases training on a single GPU; the tiny Transformer paper shows that post-training compression/quantization can retain accuracy while enabling edge deployment. • torch_ecg offers MIT-BIH readers, preprocessing (resample, bandpass, normalization), and augmentation utilities, lowering engineering burden. • For evaluation, follow AAMI EC57 5-class mapping and inter-patient splits (e.g., DS1/DS2) and report macro-F1 along with per-class sensitivity/PPV to reflect class imbalance. ([github.com](https://github.com/emadeldeen24/ECGTransForm))

Bottom line: Among recent options, a 1D multi-scale CNN + bidirectional Transformer encoder with channel recalibration and a class-imbalance–aware loss (ECGTransForm) best matches your input (1000, 2), has strong, published MIT-BIH results and open PyTorch code, and can be slimmed or quantized if needed—while preserving accuracy close to SOTA and avoiding the extra dependency on time–frequency image generation.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Lightweight Transformers can be extremely efficient: a 6k-parameter tiny 1D Transformer achieved 98.97% accuracy on MIT-BIH 5-class and ran in 4.28 ms at 0.09 mJ on GAP9 with 8-bit inference. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10748?utm_source=openai))
2. Vision-style attention also works when signals are converted to wavelet time–frequency maps: a Swin Transformer reported 99.34% intra-patient and 98.37% inter-patient accuracies on MIT-BIH. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1401143/full))
3. A CNN+Transformer hybrid (ECGTransForm) with multi-scale convolutions, channel recalibration, bidirectional Transformer blocks, and a context-aware loss achieved 99.35±0.16 accuracy and 94.26±0.28 macro-F1 on MIT-BIH, with an open-source PyTorch implementation. ([github.com](https://github.com/emadeldeen24/ECGTransForm/raw/main/misc/ecgTransform_res.png))
4. Improving inter-patient generalization is critical: adversarial pretraining to produce patient-invariant beat-score maps increased inter-patient F1 by 14.27% overall and by 27.70% for AF rhythms on MIT-BIH. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/16/7227?utm_source=openai))
5. A hierarchical deep model in 2024 reported ≈0.993 F1 on 5-class MIT-BIH, reinforcing that attention-equipped, multi-stage designs remain near SOTA for arrhythmia beat classification. ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20552076241278942?utm_source=openai))

RECOMMENDED APPROACHES:
1. Adopt ECGTransForm (2024): a PyTorch 1D hybrid comprising Multi-Scale CNN front-end (for morphology), Channel Recalibration/SE, Bidirectional Transformer encoders (for rhythm context), and a Context-Aware Loss to address class imbalance. Configure in_channels=2 and input length=1000; train with strict inter-patient splits and report macro-F1. This model aligns with your (1000, 2) tensor format, has published MIT-BIH results (ACC 99.35±0.16; MF1 94.26±0.28), and open code for rapid implementation; optionally borrow quantization ideas from the tiny Transformer paper for deployment.
