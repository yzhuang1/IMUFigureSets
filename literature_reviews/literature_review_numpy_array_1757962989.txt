COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW:
From 2023–2025, ECG arrhythmia classification on MIT-BIH has been driven by three trends: lightweight transformer variants for edge deployment, hybrid CNN+temporal-feature models that inject RR-interval context, and self-supervised pretraining tailored to ECG. A 2024 IEEE TBCAS paper introduced a 6k‑parameter “tiny transformer” that attains 98.97% five‑class accuracy on MIT‑BIH with 8‑bit inference on a GAP9 MCU, illustrating that attention models can be both accurate and deployable; however, its evaluation is intra‑patient, which typically overestimates generalization versus inter‑patient protocols. ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2402.10748)) Concurrently, inter‑patient methods improved by combining multiscale 1D CNNs, attention, and explicit RR‑interval features, reporting 95.6% accuracy and strong N/S/V sensitivities on DS1→DS2 splits. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809423012223?utm_source=openai)) Self‑supervised ECG representation learning also matured: masked/double‑path objectives (e.g., NERULA) and masked reconstruction frameworks for multi‑lead signals (ST‑MEM) show consistent gains when fine‑tuned for arrhythmia tasks, helping under limited labels and noisy segments. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19348?utm_source=openai))

Across the literature, true state of the art depends on the evaluation scheme. Many recent works still report near‑99% accuracy under intra‑patient settings, including transformer and hybrid models, but inter‑patient results are lower and more realistic; solid recent inter‑patient reports range roughly 91–96% overall accuracy on five‑class AAMI mappings, with S (SVEB) and F classes remaining the hardest due to scarcity and morphology overlap with N. ([aimspress.com](https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/mbe.2024243?utm_source=openai)) For this task—two‑lead windows of shape (1000,2) from MIT‑BIH at 360 Hz—best practice is to harmonize AAMI class mapping, use patient‑disjoint DS1/DS2 partitions, incorporate RR‑interval features alongside learned morphology, and apply class‑imbalance strategies. The MIT‑BIH database provides two channels per record and ~110k annotated beats; following AAMI and de Chazal’s DS1/DS2 split remains the standard for fair reporting. ([physionet.org](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/))

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Evaluation protocol dominates reported performance; use inter‑patient DS1→DS2 with AAMI mapping to avoid leakage and inflated metrics. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7206245/?utm_source=openai))
2. RR‑interval features combined with CNN/attention substantially improve separability of N vs. S/V; inject as auxiliary inputs or late fusion. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809423012223?utm_source=openai))
3. Lightweight transformers can match heavier CNNs for beat‑level classification and are deployable on microcontrollers, but published top scores are often intra‑patient. ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2402.10748))
4. Self‑supervised masked/reconstruction objectives (e.g., NERULA, ST‑MEM) offer robust pretraining that transfers to arrhythmia classification with fewer labels. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19348?utm_source=openai))
5. Class imbalance (S, F, Q) remains a key challenge; focal/weighted losses, balanced sampling, and RR‑aware augmentation help stabilize macro‑F1. ([aimspress.com](https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/mbe.2024243?utm_source=openai))
6. Expected inter‑patient performance on five AAMI classes is roughly 91–96% accuracy with modern CNN+RR/attention designs; higher claims often reflect non‑standard splits. ([aimspress.com](https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/mbe.2024243?utm_source=openai))
7. For MIT‑BIH, ensure proper AAMI exclusions (e.g., paced beats) and patient‑disjoint splits; the dataset has 48 two‑channel records at 360 Hz with ~110k annotated beats. ([physionet.org](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/))

RECOMMENDED APPROACHES:
1. {'name': 'Hybrid 1D CNN + Transformer encoder with RR‑feature injection', 'description': 'Patchify the (1000,2) window into 32–64 tokens (Conv1d embedding), pass through 2–4 Transformer blocks (d_model 128–256, 4–8 heads, dropout 0.1–0.3), and concatenate pre/post RR intervals before the classifier. Use class‑balanced or focal loss. Rationale: CNN captures local morphology; attention models longer‑range context; RR stabilizes S vs. N. Expected inter‑patient: high‑80s to mid‑90s macro‑F1 with careful tuning. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809423012223?utm_source=openai))'}
2. {'name': 'Multiscale CNN with frequency/attention blocks + RR features', 'description': 'Stack multiscale 1D convolutions (kernels 5–17), add SE/FCBA‑style attention, and fuse 2–4 RR‑derived features (pre/post RR, local heart rate). Train with weighted/focal loss and time‑domain augmentations. Strong inter‑patient evidence (≈95.6% accuracy on DS1→DS2).

3. {'name': 'Self‑supervised pretraining (masked ECG modeling) + light classifier', 'description': 'Pretrain an encoder on MIT‑BIH (and other ECG corpora) with masked reconstruction or dual‑path objectives, then fine‑tune a small classifier on your five classes. Works well when labeled samples per patient are limited or noisy. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19348?utm_source=openai))'}
4. {'name': 'Sequence‑to‑sequence continuous labeling (beat detection + classification)', 'description': 'For longer spans, use a detector‑classifier (e.g., transformer/U‑Net variant) that predicts beat positions and labels jointly, avoiding strict R‑peak pre‑segmentation and capturing inter‑beat dependencies. Useful if your (1000,2) windows contain multiple beats. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35227968/?utm_source=openai))'}
