COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW:
Recent developments (2023–2025) in ECG arrhythmia classification center on lightweight Transformers, convolution–attention hybrids, and self‑supervised pretraining on large ECG corpora. Notable advances include masked‑autoencoder style pretraining tailored to 1D ECG (MTECG and related MAE variants), which consistently improves downstream classification on PTB‑XL and other datasets; compact Transformer designs that keep parameter counts in the 10^3–10^5 range for edge deployment; and hybrid CNN+Transformer models that capture local morphology and global context. Representative works report high performance: Masked Transformer pretraining boosts macro‑F1 on PTB‑XL and multi‑center data; a tiny 6k‑parameter Transformer attains near‑99% accuracy for 5‑class MIT‑BIH in embedded settings; and CAT‑Net style CNN+attention+Transformer hybrids achieve >94% macro‑F1 on MIT‑BIH with attention to class imbalance. Prototype‑based and contrastive/self‑supervised methods are emerging to improve interpretability and generalization, while detection‑style Transformers (e.g., ECG‑DETR) target continuous segments without explicit beat segmentation. Together, these trends emphasize pretraining, efficient attention, and stronger handling of rare classes. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07136?utm_source=openai))

For your setting—numpy arrays of shape (1000, 2) from the MIT‑BIH Arrhythmia Database with 5 classes (AAMI EC57 N/S/V/F/Q)—state‑of‑the‑art practice is to (a) standardize two‑lead segments, (b) map beat labels to AAMI groups, (c) enforce strict inter‑patient splits, and (d) use either a multi‑scale CNN+Transformer or a compact Transformer/TCN with imbalance‑aware training. Reported “>98–99% accuracy” on MIT‑BIH is often tied to random or intra‑patient splits; with proper inter‑patient evaluation, strong modern models typically land around macro‑F1 ≈ 90–95% for 5‑class beat classification, with the better recent hybrids reaching >94% macro‑F1 on MIT‑BIH. The database itself contains 48 half‑hour, two‑channel records at 360 Hz with ≈110k annotated beats; AAMI mapping and class definitions remain the standard for benchmarking. These choices align well with your fixed 1000‑sample windows (~2.8 s at 360 Hz), and two‑lead inputs can be handled as 2 channels in 1D CNNs or as a 2‑dim feature dimension in Transformer token embeddings.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Use inter‑patient (record‑wise) splits to avoid leakage; many eye‑catching MIT‑BIH results use random/intra‑patient splits and overstate generalization. Expect macro‑F1 ≈ 90–95% for 5‑class AAMI under proper splits, with the best recent hybrids achieving ≳94%. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33082716/?utm_source=openai))
2. Hybrid CNN+Transformer backbones capture local morphology (P–QRS–T) and long‑range rhythm context better than either alone, improving S and F classes when paired with class‑imbalance remedies (e.g., SMOTE‑Tomek, focal loss, or class weights). ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809424002696?utm_source=openai))
3. Self‑supervised pretraining (masked autoencoders or contrastive learning) on large ECG datasets (e.g., PTB‑XL, institutional cohorts) transfers well to MIT‑BIH, especially for minority classes; simple fine‑tuning often outperforms from‑scratch training. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07136?utm_source=openai))
4. Lightweight Transformers and TCNs can match heavier models with orders‑of‑magnitude fewer parameters—useful for edge inference or large‑scale screening—while maintaining high 5‑class accuracy on MIT‑BIH. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10748?utm_source=openai))
5. Detection/sequence‑tagging models (e.g., ECG‑DETR) process continuous windows without explicit beat cropping, simplifying pipelines when fixed windows (1000×2) include multiple beats. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35227968/?utm_source=openai))
6. Adhering to AAMI EC57 class mapping (N, S, V, F, Q) and two‑lead signal characteristics from MIT‑BIH (48 records, 360 Hz) ensures comparability and reproducibility of results. ([physionet.org](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/x_mitdb/?utm_source=openai))
7. Minority‑class performance hinges on careful augmentation (physiologically plausible jitter/scale/drift), loss reweighting or focal loss, and sometimes RR‑interval features or relative heart‑rate cues around each beat.
