  "review_text": "Problem framing: You aim to classify ECG sequences from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database into 5 classes (AAMI EC57 superclasses N, S, V, F, Q) using torch tensors shaped (1000, 2), i.e., 1000 time steps with 2 leads per sample. MIT-BIH provides two-channel, 360 Hz ambulatory ECG annotated by cardiologists and is the standard benchmark for arrhythmia classification; inter-patient evaluation splits are recommended to avoid patient leakage. ([physionet.org](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent state-of-the-art (2024–2025): Methods trend toward hybrid 1D CNN + Transformer encoders for sequence modeling, often with class-imbalance handling and data augmentation. Notable recent peer-reviewed works include CAT-Net (CNN + multi-head attention + Transformer) reporting 99.14% overall accuracy and 94.69% macro-F1 on MIT-BIH 5-class with SMOTE-Tomek balancing; the paper also validates on INCART to check cross-dataset robustness. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809424002696?utm_source=openai)) A PyTorch-available Bidirectional Transformer hybrid, ECGTransForm, introduces multi-scale convolutions, channel recalibration, and a context-aware loss; public results show macro-F1 ≈94.26% on MIT-BIH 5-class and an open-source PyTorch implementation is provided. ([researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378637131_ECGTransForm_Empowering_adaptive_ECG_arrhythmia_classification_framework_with_bidirectional_transformer?utm_source=openai)) For resource-limited deployment, a 6k-parameter Tiny Transformer achieves 98.97% 5-class accuracy on MIT-BIH with 8-bit inference; measured energy is ~0.09 mJ and 4.28 ms per inference on GAP9, underscoring that attention models can be extremely compact. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10748?utm_source=openai))\n\nSurveys/meta-analyses (2024–2025): A 2024 MIT-BIH-focused survey synthesizes computational methods (including graph-based analyses) and highlights evaluation pitfalls on this database. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3197/12/2/21?utm_source=openai)) A 2025 survey in Artificial Intelligence Review specifically covers Transformers/LLMs for ECG diagnosis, outlining advances (e.g., positional encodings, long-range dependency capture), challenges (data imbalance, domain shift), and future directions, supporting the suitability of Transformer hybrids for ECG time series. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-025-11259-x?utm_source=openai))\n\nArchitectural patterns observed: (a) local morphology extractors (1D CNNs, sometimes multi-scale/dilated) front a (b) self-attention encoder for long-range rhythm context, followed by (c) class-imbalance remedies (focal/context-aware losses, re-sampling) and (d) lightweight heads. CAT-Net and ECGTransForm exemplify these design choices and report strong macro-F1 on the AAMI 5-class setup; Tiny Transformer demonstrates the lower bound on compute for near-SOTA accuracy. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809424002696?utm_source=openai))\n\nComputational considerations: When sequences are 1k samples × 2 leads, a compact CNN+Transformer stack remains efficient on modern GPUs/CPUs. CAT-Net’s gains on minority classes rely on SMOTE-Tomek; ECGTransForm’s context-aware loss serves a similar need. If deployment is constrained (edge/wearables), the Tiny Transformer’s 6k parameters with 8-bit inference is a strong reference point for complexity, though its reported results use single-lead inputs and may require adaptation for two leads. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809424002696?utm_source=openai))\n\nEvaluation notes: Use inter-patient splits on MIT-BIH and report macro-F1 and per-class sensitivity (especially S and F classes) to avoid optimistic leakage. The MIT-BIH PhysioNet page documents two-channel signals and standard access details. ([physionet.org](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/?utm_source=openai))",
