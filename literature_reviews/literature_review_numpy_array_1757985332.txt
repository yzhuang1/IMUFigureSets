COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW:
From 2023–2025, arrhythmia detection on MIT-BIH has been driven by three trends: Transformer-family sequence models, state-space models (SSMs), and self-supervised/foundation pretraining. Lightweight or hybrid Transformers tailored to 1D signals now achieve strong five-class AAMI performance with far fewer parameters; for example, a 6k‑parameter Tiny Transformer reports 98.97% accuracy on 5-class MIT‑BIH with 8‑bit inference, highlighting practical deployment on edge devices. Multi-branch or local–global attention architectures fuse short-range morphology with long-range rhythm context, and wavelet/CWT or spectrogram front ends paired with Transformers/CNNs further boost robustness by exposing time–frequency structure. Concurrently, bidirectional or adaptive Transformers (e.g., ECGTransForm) and CNN‑LSTM models with channel/SE attention remain competitive, often surpassing 98% when evaluated carefully. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10748?utm_source=openai))

A parallel development is representation learning at scale: ECG foundation models and large contrastive/self-supervised encoders (2024–2025) pretrain on millions of ECGs, then fine‑tune on small labeled sets like MIT‑BIH, improving label‑efficiency and transfer. These approaches report consistent gains on arrhythmia tasks and even zero-shot transfer via ECG–text pretraining. Meanwhile, emerging SSMs (S4/Mamba) provide linear‑time sequence modeling with competitive accuracy and markedly better efficiency than attention for long windows—early ECG applications (e.g., ECGMamba) show promising accuracy–efficiency tradeoffs. For rigorous benchmarking on MIT‑BIH, inter‑patient evaluation (e.g., DS1/DS2 splits) mapped to AAMI EC57 five classes (N, S, V, F, Q) is strongly recommended to avoid optimistic leakage commonly seen with intra‑patient splits. Under these protocols, recent works typically report high‑90s accuracy/F1 for 5‑class classification; expect 95–99% depending on class imbalance handling and evaluation split. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05178?utm_source=openai))

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Use inter‑patient splits aligned with AAMI EC57 (e.g., DS1/DS2) to avoid patient overlap; intra‑patient protocols can inflate results. Map beat labels to the five AAMI classes N/S/V/F/Q before training/evaluation. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.15367v2?utm_source=openai))
2. Hybrid 1D CNN + attention/Transformer encoders capture local morphology and global rhythm, consistently yielding high 5‑class performance on MIT‑BIH. ([github.com](https://github.com/emadeldeen24/ECGTransForm?utm_source=openai))
3. Lightweight Transformers and SSMs (e.g., Tiny Transformer, ECGMamba) provide near‑SOTA accuracy with much lower compute and memory—well‑suited for sequence length ≈1000 and 2 leads. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10748?utm_source=openai))
4. Time–frequency front ends (CWT/STFT) plus multi‑branch Transformers or 2D CNNs improve robustness to noise and variable morphology. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38434292/?utm_source=openai))
5. Self‑supervised/foundation models pretrained on millions of ECGs transfer effectively to MIT‑BIH, improving label efficiency and downstream accuracy; multimodal ECG–text pretraining enables zero‑shot generalization. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39631267/?utm_source=openai))
6. For PyTorch implementations on (batch, 2, 1000) tensors: standardize per‑record (z‑score), apply class‑balanced sampling or focal loss, and use mixed precision (AMP) with AdamW, cosine decay, weight decay 1e‑4–1e‑2, dropout 0.1–0.3; gradient clipping (0.5–1.0) stabilizes training.
7. Expected performance on rigorous inter‑patient 5‑class AAMI splits is typically 95–99% accuracy/F1 when using modern CNN‑Transformer/SSM models with proper imbalance handling; claims above 99% should be scrutinized for protocol details.
