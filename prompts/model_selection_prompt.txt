You are a machine learning expert who needs to recommend the most suitable neural network architecture based on data characteristics.

Data feature information:
{data_profile_json}

Please recommend the most suitable neural network architecture based on the following information:

1. Data feature analysis:
   - Data type: {data_type}
   - Data shape: {data_shape}
   - Sample count: {sample_count}
   - Feature count: {feature_count}
   - Has labels: {has_labels}
   - Label count: {label_count}

2. Data characteristics:
   - Is sequence data: {is_sequence}
   - Is image data: {is_image}
   - Is tabular data: {is_tabular}

Please select the most suitable from the following predefined model types:

**Tabular Data Models:**
- TabMLP: Multi-layer perceptron for tabular data
- TabTransformer: Transformer-based tabular data model
- TabNet: Interpretable tabular data model

**Image Data Models:**

- ResNet: Residual network
- EfficientNet: Efficient convolutional neural network
- VisionTransformer: Transformer-based image model

**Sequence Data Models:**
- TinyCNN1D: 1D convolutional neural network
- LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory network
- GRU: Gated Recurrent Unit
- Transformer: Attention-based sequence model

**General Models:**
- MLP: General multi-layer perceptron
- AutoEncoder: Autoencoder

Please return the recommendation result in JSON format as follows:
{{
    "model_name": "Recommended model name",
    "model_type": "Model type (e.g., tabular, image, sequence, general)",
    "architecture": "Specific architecture description",
    "input_shape": [Array of input shapes],
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of recommendation reason",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "hyperparameters": {{
        "hidden_size": 128,
        "num_layers": 3,
        "dropout": 0.2,
        "learning_rate": 0.001
    }}
}}

Please ensure the recommendation result is based on data characteristics and provide reasonable recommendation reasons.{exclusion_text}
