You are a machine learning expert who needs to recommend the most suitable neural network architecture based on data characteristics.

Data feature information:
{data_profile_json}

Please recommend the most suitable neural network architecture based on the following information:

1. Data feature analysis:
   - Data type: {data_type}
   - Data shape: {data_shape}
   - Sample count: {sample_count}
   - Feature count: {feature_count}
   - Has labels: {has_labels}
   - Label count: {label_count}

2. Data characteristics:
   - Is sequence data: {is_sequence}
   - Is image data: {is_image}
   - Is tabular data: {is_tabular}

Please select the most suitable from the following predefined model types:

**Available Models:**
- TabMLP: Multi-layer perceptron for tabular data
- SmallCNN: Small convolutional neural network for image data
- TinyCNN1D: 1D convolutional neural network for sequence data

IMPORTANT: Only recommend from these three models that are actually available in the system:
1. TabMLP - for tabular/structured data (ALWAYS use this for tabular data like CSV with numerical features)
2. SmallCNN - for image data only
3. TinyCNN1D - for sequence/time series data only

For tabular data (including flattened features from any source), ALWAYS recommend TabMLP as it is specifically designed for this type of data.

Please return the recommendation result in JSON format as follows:
{{
    "model_name": "Recommended model name",
    "model_type": "Model type (e.g., tabular, image, sequence, general)",
    "architecture": "Specific architecture description",
    "input_shape": [Array of input shapes],
    "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of recommendation reason",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "hyperparameters": {{
        "hidden_size": 128,
        "num_layers": 3,
        "dropout": 0.2,
        "learning_rate": 0.001
    }}
}}

Please ensure the recommendation result is based on data characteristics and provide reasonable recommendation reasons.{exclusion_text}
