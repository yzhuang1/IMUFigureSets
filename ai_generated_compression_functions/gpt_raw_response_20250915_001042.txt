    "description": "This function loads a LSTM-based PyTorch model, applies INT8 quantization for parameter reduction, and uses unstructured pruning to decrease the number of parameters of LSTM layers significantly. It then removes the pruning reparametrization to finalize the model size reduction and saves the compressed model to the specified path."
