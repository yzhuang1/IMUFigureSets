    "description": "This function takes a path to a PyTorch LSTM model, applies pruning and quantization, and saves the compressed model. Pruning reduces the number of parameters by removing weights with minimal contribution to output. Quantization reduces the number of bits required to represent each weight. Together, these techniques significantly decrease the model size while aiming to maintain performance close to the original."
