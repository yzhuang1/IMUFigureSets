# Generated Training Functions

This folder contains AI-generated training function cache stored as JSON files.

## Contents

- **Training Function Cache** - AI-generated complete training functions saved as JSON
- **CodeRecommendation Objects** - Contains generated code, hyperparameters, and reasoning
- **Model Architecture Definitions** - Various neural network architectures generated by GPT

## Structure

Files are named with pattern: `training_function_{architecture}_{timestamp}.json`

## Purpose

- Caches AI-generated training functions to avoid regenerating identical code
- Stores complete executable training functions with hyperparameter configurations
- Enables reuse of successful model architectures
- Provides audit trail of AI-generated code

Generated by the `AICodeGenerator` class using OpenAI's GPT models.
