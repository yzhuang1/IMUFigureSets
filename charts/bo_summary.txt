AI RECOMMENDATION:
------------------------------
Model: TabMLP
Reasoning: The TabMLP model is the most suitable for this task because it is specifically designed for tabular data, which matches the data type in this case. The data is not sequential or image data, so the SmallCNN and TinyCNN1D models are not appropriate. The TabMLP model can handle the high feature count (2000) and the moderate sample count (500).
Confidence: 0.95
