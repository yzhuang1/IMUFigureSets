CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No text before or after the JSON.

Analyze this PyTorch training error and provide hyperparameter corrections.

PyTorch Version: 2.5.1+cu121
Training Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'type'
Training Code Context: import copy

RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY a JSON object
2. No explanations, no markdown, no ```json``` blocks
3. Start with { and end with }
4. If you cannot fix the error, return {}

CORRECTION EXAMPLES:
- "Model has X parameters, exceeds 256k limit" → {"d_model": 64, "hidden_size": 128}
- "embed_dim must be divisible by num_heads" → {"d_model": 96, "nhead": 4}
- "'str' object has no attribute 'update'" → {} (Python coding bug, cannot fix with hyperparameters)
- "Expected all tensors to be on the same device" → {} (code issue, not hyperparameter issue)
- "mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied" → {"d_model": 128} (dimension mismatch)

OUTPUT ONLY THE JSON OBJECT:
